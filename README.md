FORMULAS AND TECHNIQUES IN EXCEL.

I learnt how to use some advanced formulars and functions in excel.
The IF function in Excel which works like a simple decision-making tool. It checks a condition and gives one result if it's TRUE and another if it's FALSE.
The AND function is like a strict teacher—it only says TRUE if all conditions are met. Otherwise, it returns FALSE.
The OR function is more relaxed than AND. It returns TRUE if at least one condition is met. It only returns FALSE if none of the conditions are met.
You can mix the IF,AND,OR functions for advanced logic.

VLOOKUP to search down a column and returns data from the right.
HLOOKUP to search across a row and returns data below.
XLOOKUP search in any direction (left, right, up, or down)—no more limitations!
INDEX returns a value from a specific row and column in a range.
MATCH finds the position of a value in a row or column.

Also, it is better to use INDEX & MATCH instead of VLOOKUP because of the following below:-
More flexible (can search left or right).
Faster for large datasets.
Less prone to errors when inserting/deleting columns.
